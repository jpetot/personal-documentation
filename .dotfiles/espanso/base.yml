# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ":espanso"
    replace: "Hi there!"

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%d/%m/%Y"

  # Tech weekly date
  - trigger: ":tech"
    replace: "Tech weekly - {{dayyear}}"
    vars:	 
      - name: dayyear
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%A %B %d, %Y"

  # gif 
  - trigger: ":charlax-party"
    image_path: "/Users/julien/personnal-documentation/img/charlax-party.gif"

# link
  - trigger: :mdi
    replace: "![]({{clip}})"
    vars:
      - name: clip
        type: "clipboard"
  - trigger: :mdl
    replace: "[]({{clip}})"
    vars:
      - name: clip
        type: "clipboard"
  - trigger: :nomail
    replace: "#No rsvp received#"
  - trigger: :thread
    image_path: "/Users/julien/personnal-documentation/img/Slack-Reply-To-Thread.png"
